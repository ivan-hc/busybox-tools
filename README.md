# busybox-tools
Re-host official static binaries from [busybox.net](https://www.busybox.net)

## Reason

The site https://www.busybox.net is often subject to strong slowdowns, probably due to the lack of mirrors that can speed up not only the download of individual binaries, but also the connection to all pages, as well as to the homepage itself.

This repository will take care of downloading the official binaries and hosting them here
- https://github.com/ivan-hc/busybox-tools/tree/main/x86_64-binaries
- https://github.com/ivan-hc/busybox-tools/tree/main/i686-binaries

...in order to speed up the download.

Il controllo e il caricamento/aggiornamento vengono effettuati una volta al mese.
